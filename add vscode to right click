To make the right-click menu show the "Show more options" option by default in Windows 11, you can change a setting that reverts the right-click menu to the classic style. Here's how to do it:

Method 1: Modify Registry (To Show Classic Right-Click Menu by Default)
Press Win + R, type regedit, and press Enter to open Registry Editor.
Navigate to the following key:
objectivec
Copy
Edit
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID
Right-click on the CLSID folder > New > Key.
Name the new key as:
Copy
Edit
{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}
Right-click on the new key you just created > New > Key again.
Name this new key as:
Copy
Edit
InprocServer32
Double-click on the (Default) value in the InprocServer32 folder and set its Value Data to an empty string (leave it blank).
Close Registry Editor and restart your PC.
Method 2: Revert Back (Undo Changes)
If you ever want to revert this change and go back to the default right-click behavior (where you have the "Show more options" option):

Navigate back to the same key in the Registry (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID).
Right-click the key {86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2} and Delete it.
Restart your PC.
